        <a class="a1">High School:</a><br /><br />
        As of now, I am technically a high school graduate with only my high
        school degree if I try to pursue work.<br />
        I studied in
        <a href="https://twitter.com/moe_jdh_10_1057?lang=ar">Al Noor School</a>
        for all of my pre-uni academic life. It's a cozy school with pretty good
        teachers who did their best, and I came out relativley on top. Through
        this school I was able to learn english and hone and perfect it over
        time.<br /><br />

        <a class="a1">University:</a><br /><br />
        I am currently studying in the
        <a href="https://www.uj.edu.sa">University of Jeddah</a>
        (UJ) and pursuing a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.<br />
        Studying in UJ can be very tough considering it's located in the middle
        of nowhere, but I've been attending it for 4 years now which shows how
        dedicated I am.<br />
        Putting the grueling road aside, studying in UJ has been quite the
        challenge due to its strict curriculum, difficult yet informative
        professors, and challenging tasks that are guaranteed to enhance your
        skills.<br /><br />
